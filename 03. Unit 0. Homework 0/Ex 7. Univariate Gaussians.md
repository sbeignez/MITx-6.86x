# 7. Univariate Gaussians

A univariate Gaussian or normal distributions can be completely determined by its mean and variance.

Gaussian distributions can be applied to a large numbers of problems because of the central limit theorem (CLT). The CLT posits that when a large number of independent and identically distributed ((i.i.d.) random variables are added, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of their sum is approximated by the cdf of a normal distribution.

Recall the probability density function of the univariate Gaussian with mean $ \mu $ and variance $ \sigmaË†2 $, :
