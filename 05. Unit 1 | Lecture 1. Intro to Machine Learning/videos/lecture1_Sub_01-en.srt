00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,340
Hello, this is machine learning lecture number one.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,350
Machine learning it's already everywhere.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,430
So it is a topic that you should know something about.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,920
For example, if you type in a search query on the web,

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,830
how that query is interpreted, how the websites that you're

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,790
looking for are interpreted, and how the match between the two

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,700
is made, all of this is run by machine learning algorithms.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,070
If you look at movie recommendations provided

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,490
to you, they are provided to you by machine learning algorithms

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,320
exploiting your previous experience with the site.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,960
Going a step further, automated systems

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,550
like Amazon Alexa, the Google Assistant, or Siri,

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,300
they all run on top of machine learning algorithms.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,590
Machine learning is used to interpret speeds

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,740
to natural languages, how the natural language

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,760
itself is interpreted, how its mapped to content that you're

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,720
looking for, or the commands that you

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,080
are interested in executing.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,990
Machine learning is regularly used for image analysis.

20
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,630
For example, in a self-driving vehicle,

21
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,010
the unfolding scene coming from camera input

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,870
is interpreted by machine learning algorithms.

23
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,310
Machine learning has also achieved

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,330
several benchmark tests, for example,

25
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,240
surpassing human level performance in game playing,

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,080
such as game of Go recently.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,850
Machine learning is being adopted

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,860
by different disciplines, for example biology, chemistry,

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,780
physics, and so on.

30
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,940
So it is everywhere.

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,060
And we need to understand what it is

32
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,300
and how to make use of it.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,950


34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,400
So let's start by defining exactly

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,380
what machine learning is.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,430
As a discipline, it aims to design, understand, and apply

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,340
computer programs that really learn from experience, OK?

38
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,590
There are many ways to learn or many reasons to learn.

39
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,310
You can try to model, understand how things work.

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,630
You can try to predict about, say, future outcomes

41
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,020
or try to control towards a desired output configuration.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,330
We will start by focusing on prediction as a core machine

43
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,620
learning task.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,570
So let's take a few examples to understand what this actually

45
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,310
is.

46
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,870
You can make predictions about future events.

47
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,910
So for example, you may have a market value of a stock

48
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,400
measured as a function of time.

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,420
And you see some historical behavior of that stock.

50
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,750
And you wish to predict what happens next day.

51
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,910
In a similar vein, in a self-driving vehicle,

52
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,700
you can try to predict whether a collision is about to happen.

53
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,290
In a medical context, you might predict

54
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,640
the risk of acquiring or getting a recurrence for a disease

55
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,700
and so on.

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,460
There are many problems that machine learning algorithms

57
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,580
can help you to predict about future events.

58
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,550


59
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,610
Now, there are other types of predictions that you can make,

60
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,210
not only about events that are about to occur

61
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,570
but about properties you do not yet know.

62
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,870
For example, I can take a movie and ask whether you

63
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,640
would like this movie.

64
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
That is a prediction of a property

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,620
of a movie, whether you like it or not,

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,000
that I can learn to predict.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,660
I can ask about molecules, whether a molecule here

68
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,300
is soluble in water or another substance.

69
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,500
It is a property that I can learn to predict.

70
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,460
I can learn to predict properties about images.

71
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,260
What is the content in the image, a category that

72
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,910
should be associated with the image,

73
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,510
that it's about mushrooms?

74
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,400
In a more structured way, I can also turn machine translation

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,420
into this form.

76
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,560
I can take a sentence in English and ask,

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,000
what is the corresponding sentence in Spanish?
