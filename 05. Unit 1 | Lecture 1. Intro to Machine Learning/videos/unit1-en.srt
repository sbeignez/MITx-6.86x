00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890


1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,880
So in this course, you will see two types of lectures.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,870
Tablet lectures where you will see me writing on the tablet

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,500
and hear my voice but not actually see my face.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,490
You will also see live blackboard lectures

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,260
given by Professor Barzilay.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,670
And we will alternate different topics given by me

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,540
and given by Professor Barzilay.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,110
Now, this course has five units.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,430
Unit number 1 focuses on very basic building block

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,030
of machine learning methods called linear classification.

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,440
And you will learn a very basic algorithm

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,140
for solving that problem that will carry on later on.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,040
And you can use it to solve much more complicated problems

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,610
as well.

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,840
Now, as an illustration then to understand

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,450
how these methods actually apply in practice,

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,330
you will also be solving a project.

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,700
This is like a mini application, going through motions

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,640
that you would have to do if you actually solved

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,320
a real application problem.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,110
So the application in this case is predicting whether an Amazon

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,420
product review, looking at only the text,

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,630
whether the review is positive or negative.

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,750
Now, we expect that there is a little bit

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,110
of a gap between what we have taught you

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,800
and what is precisely required to solve this project.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,800
So we expect you to think through and try to figure out

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,740
what type of features to use, to feed

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,674
in to the linear classifier, and so on.

30
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:45,174
