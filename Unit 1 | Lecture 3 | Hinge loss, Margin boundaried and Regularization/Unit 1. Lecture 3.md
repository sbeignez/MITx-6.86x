Unit 1. Lecture 3. Hinge loss, Margin boundaries and Regularization

# 1. Objective

Hinge loss, Margin boundaries, and Regularization

* understand the need for maximizing the margin
* pose linear classification as an optimization problem
* understand hinge loss, margin boundaries and regularizatio

# 2. 

Large margin classifier

Margins boundaries (positive and negative)

Regularization ??

Loss 

Objective function = min (loss + )


# 3. Margin Boundary

Margins boundaries are 2 lines, equidistant from the decision boundary

DB: $ \theta \cdot x + \theta_o = 0 $
